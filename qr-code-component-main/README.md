## Overview
This newbie challenge is a test of CSS Flexbox skills. The challenge was to build a page that had a centered div containing a QR code and text.

## My process
Beginning with the design, I mapped out where divs would need to be, and classed them accordingly. Using the styles provided, I created my root variables, and then moved on to building out the css flexbox layout. Finally I tweaked each section to get the proper padding, margins, and overall look, and added a few media queries to maintain the sizing throughout.   

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was a fantastic opportunity to practice flexbox properties. It was a fun and quick challenge.
